    <h1>What is the Internet?</h1>
    <p>The Internet is a high-speed global interconnection of independently operated computer networks that is fully distributed without any central administration. It is the ultimate tool for sharing information.  It is used for sending and receiving data in a binary format which is comprised of bits with 2 possible states (values):  on and off (or 1 and 0).  Binary data is measured in bytes where 8 bits equals 1 byte.  Bandwidth is the transmission capacity of the network and is measured by bitrate.  Bitrate is the number of bits per second that the network can process.  Latency is a measurement of the amount of time required for information to travel from sender to receiver.  Ethernet wire is a cheap physical medium for a network but the signal strength is degraded significantly over longer distances.  Fiber optic cables which are made of glass strands can transmit information in the form of light with virtually no signal loss over long distances.  However, fiber is very expensive and difficult to physically implement in a network.  Wireless systems use radio transmitters to carry the data but this requires translation of the binary data into radio waves of different frequencies and a reverse translation back to binary at the end of the wireless network.   While it is much more mobile than ethernet, the signal strength also drops over longer distances.  Check out the summarized topics below with a link to each topic for more details.</p>

    <p class="lead">An IP Address is an identifier assigned to every device connected to a network that utilizes the Internet Protocol (IP) for communication.  Packets are units of data formatted to contain control instructions as well as the user data.  Routers are devices that direct the traffic of packets across the network based on the IP addresses of the sender and receiver.</p>
