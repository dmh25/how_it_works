    <h2>What is The Internet?</h2>
    <p>What is the Internet?  The Internet is a high-speed global interconnection of independently operated computer networks that is fully distributed without any central administration. It is the ultimate tool for sharing information.  It it used for sending and receiving binary information which is comprised of bits with 2 possible states (values) of on and off (or 1 and 0).  Binary data is measured in bytes where 8 bits equals 1 byte.  Bandwidth is the transmission capacity of the network and is measured by bitrate.  Bitrate is the number of bits per second that the network can process.  Latency is a measurement of the amount of time required for information to travel from sender to receiver.  Ethernet wire is cheap physical medium for a network but the signal strength is degraded significantly over longer distances.  Fiber optic cables which are made of glass strands can transmit information in the form of light with virtually no signal loss over long distances.  However, fiber is uber expensive and difficult to physically implement in a network.  Wireless systems use radio transmitters to carry the data but this requires translation of the binary data into radio waves of different frequencies and a reverse translation back to binary at then end of wireless network.   While it is much more mobile than ethernet, the signal strength also drops over longer distances.</p>
