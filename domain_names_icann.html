    <h2>What is a Domain Name?</h2>
    <p>A domain name is an identification string that defines a realm of administrative control within the Internet.  Domain names are used in various networking contexts and for application-specific naming and addressing purposes.  Domain names are formed by the rules and procedures of the Domain Name System (DNS) and any name registered in the DNS is a domain name. Domain names are organized in subordinate levels (subdomains) of the DNS root domain. The first-level set of domain names are the top-level domains (TLDs), including but not limited to the prominent domains com, info, net, edu, and org.  The second-level and third-level domain names are typically open for reservation by end-users who wish to connect local area networks to the Internet, create other publicly accessible Internet resources or run web sites.  Domain names provide easily recognizable and memorizable names that link to  numerically addressed Internet resources. This abstraction allows any resource to be moved to a different physical location in the address topology of the network, globally or locally in an intranet. This relocation would just require changing the IP address of the resource and the corresponding translation of that IP address to and from its domain name.</p>

    <h2>What is ICANN?</h2>
    <p>ICANN stands for the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers.  Founded in September 1998 ,it is a non-profit organization tasked with managing the names and numbers that serve as placeholders within the Internet.  The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) manages the allocation of IP address globally as well as root zone management within the Domain Naming System (DNS). ICANN is responsible for the maintenance of Central Internet Address pools and DNS root zone registries based on requirements in the IANA function contract.  These maintenance activities enable the Internet to be safe and reliable.  Most of ICANNâ€™s focus is on the Internet's global Domain Name System (DNS), including policy development for international standardization of the DNS system, insertion of new generic top-level domains (TLDs), and the function of root name servers.  ICANN also manages the IP address spaces for IPv4 (decimal) and IPv6 (hexadecimal), as well as the assignment of address blocks to regional Internet registries.</p>
    <h2>History of ICANN</h2>
    <p>Before ICANN was created, the IANA function of administering registries of Internet protocol identifiers and distribution of TLDs and IP addresses was performed by Jon Postel, a Computer Science researcher who had been involved in the creation of ARPANET.  ARPANET stands for the Advanced Research Projects Agency Network.  It was the first wide-area packet-switching network with distributed control and one of the first networks to implement the TCP/IP protocol suite.  As the Internet grew and expanded globally, the U.S. Department of Commerce initiated a process to establish a new organization to perform the IANA functions.  The new organization would need to privatize the management of Internet names and addresses in a manner that allows for the development of competition and facilitates global participation in Internet management.  ICANN was formed to accomplish these goals while under contract to the US Department of Commerce and in agreement with standards put forth by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF).</p>
    <h2>Structure of ICANN</h2>
    <p>ICANN is managed by a 16-member board of directors.  8 members are selected by a nominating committee on which all the constituencies of ICANN are represented.  6 members are representatives of its Supporting Organizations which deal with certain portions of policies within ICANN's scope.  1 seat is filled by an "at-large" organization and the last seat is occupied by the President/CEO who is appointed by the board.  There are currently three supporting organizations: the Generic Names Supporting Organization (GNSO), the Country Code Names Supporting Organization (ccNSO), and the Address Supporting Organization (ASO).  These organizations deal with policies for generic TLDs, country-code TLDs, and IP addressing.  ICANN also relies on input from some advisory committees including the Governmental Advisory Committee (GAC), the At-Large Advisory Committee (ALAC), the Root Server System Advisory Committee, the Security and Stability Advisory Committee (SSAC), and the Technical Liaison Group (TLG).</p>
