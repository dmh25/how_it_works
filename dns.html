    <h1>DNS </h1>

    <h2>What is DNS?</h2>
    <p>DNS stands for Domain Name System (DNS).  It is a hierarchical and decentralized naming system for computers, services, or other resources connected to the Internet as well as private networks. The domain names administered by ICANN are assigned to each participating entity. Most importantly, DNS translates domain names (which are easy to remember) to the numerical IP addresses associated with computer services and devices while utilizing the underlying network protocols. By translating hostnames to IP addresses (and vice versa), the Domain Name System has been an essential component of Internet functionality since 1985.  </p>
    <h2>How Does DNS Work?</h2>
    <p>DNS designates authoritative name servers which are responsible for assigning domain names and mapping those names to resources for each domain.  Administrators of the networks that use these domains can delegate authority of their namespace to other name servers thereby providing a decentralized administrative structure resulting in inherent fault-tolerance.  The mappings of IP address to resource name (along with other related records) are stored in the DNS database traditionally in the form of a structured text file (known as a Zone file) but other methods also exist. The most common types of records stored in the DNS database are for Start of Authority (SOA) which relates to DNS zone details, name to IP address mappings (for IPv4 and IPv6), SMTP mail exchangers (MX), name servers (NS), pointers for reverse DNS lookups (PTR) which translate from name to IP, and domain name aliases (CNAME).  The right to use a domain name is delegated by domain name registrars which are accredited by the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN).</p>
    <h2>Functionality Details</h2>
    <p>Administrators can change a resource's location on the network without affecting the end users because the DNS can be quickly and transparently updated, while users continue to use the same hostname. Uniform Resource Locators (URLs) and e-mail addresses can easily be referenced and utilized without users having to know how their computer actually locates the desired services.  Another important function of the DNS is its support of distributed Internet services such as cloud services and content delivery networks.  DNS allows for the translation of a requested URL to return with the IP address of the resource that is closest to the requestor.  This not only supports the distributed architecture of cloud services but also ensures faster and more reliable responses to user queries.</p>
    <h2>Structure</h2>
    <p>The domain name space consists of a tree data structure with each leaf (node) in the tree having a label and resource records (RR) which hold information associated with the domain name. The domain name itself consists of the label, concatenated with the name of its parent node on the right, separated by a dot (eg. google.com).  The tree sub-divides into zones beginning at the root zone. Depending on the choices of the DNS administrator, a DNS zone may consist of only one domain, or many domains and sub-domains. Administrative responsibility for any zone may be divided by simply creating additional zones and delegating authority to a designated name server resulting in the parent zone ceasing to be authoritative for the new zone.  The right-most label conveys the top-level domain (TLD) and the hierarchy of domains descends from right to left.  The DNS is maintained by a distributed database system, utilizing the clientâ€“server model, with the name servers serving as the nodes of the model. Each domain has at least one authoritative DNS server that publishes information about that domain and the name servers of any domains subordinate to it. An authoritative name server can either be a primary server containing original copies of all zone records or a secondary server containing automatically updated identical copies of all zone records.
    <h2>Operation</h2>
    The client side of the DNS is called a DNS resolver which is responsible for initiating and sequencing the queries that ultimately lead to a full translation of a domain name into an IP address (or other DNS-related query). DNS resolvers are classified by query method which can be recursive, non-recursive, and iterative, and the resolution process may use a combination of these methods.  In a non-recursive query, a DNS resolver queries a DNS server that provides a record either for which the server is authoritative, or it provides a partial result without querying other servers to reduce the load on upstream DNS servers.  In a recursive query, a DNS resolver queries a single DNS server, which may in turn query other DNS servers on behalf of the requester.  The iterative query procedure is a process in which a DNS resolver queries a chain of one or more DNS servers.  A standard practice in implementing name resolution in applications is to reduce the load on the Domain Name System servers by caching results locally, or in intermediate resolver hosts. Results obtained from a DNS request are always associated with a Time To Live (TTL) value, which indicates how long a record can remain accurate before the results must be discarded or refreshed. The TTL is set by the administrator of the authoritative DNS server and the value can vary from a few seconds to days or even weeks depending on the domain.
